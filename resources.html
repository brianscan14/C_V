                <p>
                    <u><strong>Lazy Registration:</strong></u> This concept was essentialy used when creating the contact forms as they were simple
                    and didn't seem too taskign to the user. Nothing was thrown onto thew user on this page, if they wanted to find
                    out more or were interested in something they could simple click one of the buttons to see it
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Clear primary actions:</strong></u> This was utilised on buttons seen in the contact forms to 'send' the email, it is a very
                    clear and concise command to tell the user what it will do. This is also seen with the grades buttons and the options 
                    to see more work experience on the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Hover Controls:</strong></u> The likes of the work experience content's bubbles changing background colour slightly denotes to the user
                    that this item is indeed clickable and will cause an action of some sort to occur. This is also the case with all buttons used on 
                    the page as their backgrounds change colour, also seen with the projects and interestes. Anything that is clickable changes the cursor
                    to a hand which is a universal sign to the user that this item they are on is clickable.
                </p>
                <h3 class="pt-3"><strong><em>Usability Rules and Principles</em></strong></h3>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Tiny clickable areas:</strong></u> These were avoided througghout this page, for example in the accordion for education the heading is 
                    what highlights for the user but the entire bar will call the action if clicked, so they can not miss it. This is the same in places like the 
                    interests section and also in the projects section, where the entire card itself will call the action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>No way to get in touch:</strong></u> There are multiple means of getting in touch on this page and are evident right from the intial viewing of it. 
                    There is a contact me button on the hero image which will call a modal that holds a form for the user to fill out and send a quick email straight
                    away. There is also a cotnact section in the CV with all my details etc. if the user wants to get in touch, again offering them the chance to send a 
                    quick email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>No way to search:</strong></u> There is a large magnifying glass in the nav bar which the user can use to search any string on the page that they input to it. 
                    It calls an overlay which covers the entire page and just shows the search bar, straight to what the user wants. The functionality does not work as there 
                    is no back end database to this page but the principle is in place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Old Permalinks pointing nowhere:</strong></u> There are no 'dead' links on this page, everything has been tested and they all point to where they are supposed to. Also 
                    if something fails to load properly then the text saying what it is shows up in its a place, for a example a picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Long reg forms:</strong></u> All forms (contact and even the grades) are very to the point and give user exactly what they need, they fulfill exactly what is their intended
                    purpose and do not deviate the user in any manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Usability (nightmares):</strong></u> Popups are used for better quality viewing for the user, they are easily closed, and not easily clicked by accident. No visual noise and all the 
                    content has a logical flow as a CV would. No blocks are laying on top of each other, even on smaller screens.
                </p>
                 <h3 class="pt-3"><strong><em>Gestalt Laws</em></strong></h3>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Pragnaz:</strong></u> The entire page is kept relatively simple, with not too much text, simple links etc. for the user if they do want to see more content. Otherwise they can leave 
                    things as is, a modest hero image is used, background not too distracting but it is work-like, forms etc. are kept poignant, as a CV should be
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Continuity:</strong></u> An example of this use on the page is where the years of education are listed chronologically reversed, with the newest courses coming first.
                    Then when the user clicks into a course with many years this is still maintained, however a normal sort is used here as this is the way most people would read it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Figure / Ground:</strong></u> In any of the pop ups there is enough contrast from background etc, the content is easily readable but the user also knows that it is easily clicked 
                    out of if they wish to do so. The links seen on the hero image are clearly visible to the user and in contrast to its background. 
                    All of the Grades are a readable layout, the project cards go to the actual projectâ€™s page in another tab and leave you at the CV page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Isomorphic correspondence:</strong></u> Links used throughout the page are buttons, all the headings are underlined, so there is no confusion there. The background changes on hovers, as 
                    well as the cursor which also tells the user that this item is clickable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong>Figure / Ground:</strong></u> This was used for education section, where these items are essentially inn a group ebcause they come from the same background. This is also the case in the skills 
                    section and the project sections too.

                <h3 class="pt-3"><strong><em>Bootstrap 4 (BS4)</em></strong></h3>
                <p>
                    <u><strong><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/overview/">Layout:</a></strong></u> The BS4 cols and rows layout method was used throughout this page, it is extremely useful when designing
                    a page that is going to be responsive to all screen sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/">Modal:</a></strong></u> Modals were a very poignant part of this page as they were used anywhere that I wanted to show the user a bit
                    more detail, as seen with the view grades and popup contact form. It is very handy to use when space is limited and ore detail is needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/#accordion-example">Accordion:</a></strong></u> The BS4 accordion was used in the education section to show the user my degrees but in a more interactive manner. It certainly
                     helped with the aesthetics of the page and gives a more interactive expereince for the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/">Cards:</a></strong></u> BS4 cards were used in the skills section as they offe a very consise way to show the user a glimpse of each project and also
                    fill them in with a little detail, if it has caught their interest then they can simply click it to see more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/progress/">Progress Bars:</a></strong></u> The skills utilises BS4's progress bars as a simpel yet effective manner for showing the level that I was at for each skill 
                    that is listed on the CV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All BS4 items were then modified as needed to fit the content of the page, but the intitial ground work that they complete is very time saving.
                </p>
                <h3 class="pt-3"><strong><em>Other</em></strong></h3>
                
                <p>
                    <u><strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">WE3 Schools:</a></strong></u> This was utlised for the jobs experience section timeline seen on the page and also to learn how to use some of the javascript 
                    functions seen used on the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong><a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a></strong></u> Used icons from this site throughout the page that users would be more familiar with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cavan,+Ireland/@53.9866139,-7.3905674,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x485e0c2d62912eeb:0xa00c7a997317270!8m2!3d53.9897186!4d-7.3633319">Google Maps</a></strong></u> Was used to give my 'address', the API version was not used as the functionality of the actual maps was not what was most important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u><strong><a href="https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/">Fancybox</a></strong></u> This helped show the skills pictures in a better viewing pane, along with a caption for when the user clicked on a skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pictures on the page These were taken from sites such as <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexel</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en">google images</a>.
